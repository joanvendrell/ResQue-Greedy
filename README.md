# **ResQue-Greedy: Rewiring Sequential Greedy for Improved Submodular Maximization**

<div align="justify">
We introduce Rewired Sequential Greedy (ResQue Greedy), a novel approach that leverages the concept of submodular curvature as a risk measure within 
a lattice-based framework. By probabilistically identifying sub-optimal decisions through a fault-detection mechanism, ResQue Greedy implements a 
curvature-averse rewiring strategy. This strategy opportunistically redirects the solution path within the lattice, aiming to improve the approximation
performance without significantly increasing computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that ResQue Greedy achieves stronger near-optimality
bounds compared to the standard sequential greedy algorithm.
